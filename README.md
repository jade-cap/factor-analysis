# Factor Analysis

I am a second-year master's student in strategic marketing and analytics, and I am using GitHub to showcase my progress with data analysis throughout the duration of the course. Here, I will be using the dataset embedded into the lavaan package, in R.

## Tasks include

### 4 Define a FA model

### 6 Factor Analysis

Run a factor analysis in lavaan and show the output.

### 7 Goodness of fit

Does this model seem to represent the data well? Argue with the goodness of fit measures.

### 8 Factor loadings

Which factor is the most important to explain each latent item?

### 9 Plot
